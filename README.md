Mostly glad it's over, although there are valuable lessons, that I would have
gotten at some point with less commute fatigue. Would love to finish more FCC
projects. The lack of caring in this college community is draining. What are
they even here for...

At risk of clich√©, the online community is much better. Though, through meets
I've found some eternally curious and altruistic developers in New Haven. Too
much entrepreneurship might put me off. But it's something I'll find wether
remote or local.
