# Agile Systems and Spiral Models: Brief Research

Short sentences about 6 sites concerning the titled topics. All found using *DuckDuckGo* on the internet. While there were more professional sites, some of which were businesses, these are the most accessible in my opinion and provide the greatest value.

## Agile

### Wikipedia
This website[^agile-wiki] gives a detailed overview of Agile development philosophy and its history. It further explains the ways it is used and, its pros and cons.

### Reddit
The social site *Reddit.com*[^red] is a message board of sorts with a plethora of group topics; participants are of high expertise to none at all. Browsing through the “agile” topic would give one a current understanding of the implementations, solutions, and shortcomings of agile development.

### Google site (Scrum)
A subset of agile development called Scrum[^scrum] is explained and plans of action are laid out for those who want to use scrum in their projects and teams.

## Spiral Models
Websites with original content on spiral models was difficult to find as most of them used the same diagrams and repeated the same ideas. This can be seen especially in the last two links.

### Wikipedia
A short description[^spiral-wiki] of the spiral model, its history and the philosophy, and the various ways the projects dictate the variables of the spiral to create a model.

### Max’s PM Wisdom
This is a personal site with various papers and books, one focus is project management, specifically in  software development. This page[^maxs] describes the spiral model and goes on the comparing other models.

### Airbrake.io
This is a product site for a software solution but contains a blog as well. The linked page[^air] in particular explains the spiral model and how to use it in projects.
