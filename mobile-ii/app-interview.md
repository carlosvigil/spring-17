#### Mobile Application Interview

An app that produces chapters from my favorite book. It should have different ways of displaying the chapters, like “random” and “ordered”. And have the ability to share the chapter with others. The overall design should be pleasing to the eye.

The target users are anyone in need of guidance and who wants to spread wise words to others. A mobile app allows for various connections like apps and contacts that will make sharing chapters more intimate than a website. To further differentiate from a website it could have notifications or widgets that provide the user with chapters at a specific time in the day. Users can be argued use iOS because it is more “zen”, in line with the book, but the majority of the world uses Android and would contain more of the user base familiar with the book.

There are no relevant competitors in the Apple App Store but there is also no specified business aspect to the app. Ads would clash with the passive and peaceful nature of the book and projected design aesthetic, but if they can be limited to the sharing action and use smooth transitions the app would benefit. There is no budget but also no deadline for the app’s launch. The majority of the workload would be translations and sharing APIs, with some weight on design. The app should be supported for some short amount of time after launch for immediate bug fixes and after major OS updates. There is not much functionally to the app and would not grow unless it is decided that new hardware/firmware features should be included. The book is located on the device and there is no database for users; no back-end is needed.

I am the sole person and main contact you will be working with unless the project requires professional designers or localization experts. The minimum viable product will be up to your discretion after the main functionality of displaying the book is done. It would be preferred to have a pleasing UI but the essence is in the words. After those two milestones the next would be translations of highest quality, there are many available and researching the best for each language would be a marker in itself. The number of languages will not be less than 4. The other similarly timed goal would be the sharing functions which should be done before translations but worked on simultaneously. Lastly, the proper introduction of ads would complete the current idea of the app. There is no business objective.
